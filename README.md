The project officially uses Yarn, however you can use whichever package manager you like. Install as follows:
#### NPM
```
npm i

#### Yarn

yarn
```

### Environment
- You need a `.env` file containing configuration, as follows:
  ```env
  REACT_APP_WEATHER_API_KEY = YOUR_WEATHER_KEY

- Alternatively, just set the environment variable when needed.
